## 📕 About

This website was created as a study challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

My main objective with this challenge was improve even more my HTML and CSS skills in a real project. The cellphone on the website is completely created with CSS, so this was a pretty good challenge for me to learn even more about CSS.
